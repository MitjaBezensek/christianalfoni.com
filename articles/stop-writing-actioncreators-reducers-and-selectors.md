I am the first to say that I love working with React. I feel increadibly productive. That said, I would like to jump onboard and share some of my perspectives on a specific subject. The subject of how the quest for immutability in React has negatively impacted our productivity.

## Why do we need immutability?

I am not saying immutability in itself is a negative thing. On the contrary it inherantly allows for more stable and predictable code. Languages like [Elixir]() is immutable and because of that handles concurrancy much better than other languages like [C#]() and [PHP](). [Elm]() was the first language to introduce time travel debugging, something immutability allows. That said, immutability does not
